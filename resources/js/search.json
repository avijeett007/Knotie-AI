This project consists of various Python modules, configuration, and Docker files to set up and run an AI Agent System efficiently. The project is designed to be run with Docker, so you don't need to install Python or other packages locally. However, if you wish to modify the code, you'll need to install Python and manage your Python environment. Follow the setup guide below for detailed instructions.","This documentation is organized into the following sections:","Prerequisites","Setup","Running Without Docker","Configuration","Testing","Contribution Guidelines","Further Improvements","Feel free to explore each section to get a comprehensive understanding of how to work with Knotie-AI."]},{"i":"additional-resources","l":"\uD83D\uDCDA Additional Resources","p":["GitHub Repository: Knotie-AI on GitHub","Discord Community: Join our Discord","Documentation Site: Knotie-AI Docs"]}],[{"i":"#","p":["Code of Conduct for contributing to the Knotie-AI project."]},{"i":"code-of-conduct","l":"\uD83D\uDCDC Code of Conduct"},{"l":"Our Pledge","p":["We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.","We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community."]},{"l":"Our Standards","p":["Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:","Using welcoming and inclusive language","Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences","Gracefully accepting constructive criticism","Focusing on what is best for the community","Showing empathy towards other community members","Examples of unacceptable behavior include:","The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances","Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks","Public or private harassment","Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission","Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting"]},{"l":"Enforcement Responsibilities","p":["Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful."]},{"l":"Scope","p":["This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
